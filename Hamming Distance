#The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
#Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance

class Solution:
    def hammingDistance(self, x: 'int', y: 'int') -> 'int':
        return str(int(bin(x).partition('b')[2]) + int(bin(y).partition('b')[2])).count('1')
